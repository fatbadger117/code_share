Correct steps to Git Succeed(tm):

Create a branch for work space: $ git checkout -b {new branch name}

Do some coding!

Commit and push your changes: $ git add -A $ git commit -m "message" $ git push origin {branch name}

do a pull request!

4.5) get approved from team! This completes the merge.

delete the branch from your repositories (Github and local): $ git branch -D {name of branch}

pull back into dev branch $ git pull origin dev

note\* before you can do the delete Branch pull you need to do git checkout back into the dev branch
